#		direct application to text indexing for search in logarithmic time of documents containing a set of words. Think of a collection of
#		documents as a container of the set of words that each document has. Finding all the documents that contain a set of words is
#		finding the superset of the set of words in the query. A SetTrie will give you the answer --the list of document names-- in
#		logarithmic time. The data structure is also used in auto-complete applications.""",
